# Getting started

This is a short tutorial that runs you through some basic functionality of the poseidon framework and tooling.

## Preparation
You will need to install our two command-line tools `trident` and `xerxes`. They are available as pre-compiled binaries for MacOS and Linux, and in case of trident also for Windows: 
* `trident`: https://github.com/poseidon-framework/poseidon-hs/releases/latest
* `xerxes`: https://github.com/poseidon-framework/poseidon-analysis-hs/releases/latest

You can also install those tools from bioconda (...)
