# qjanno CLI software

`qjanno` is a command line tool to run SQL queries on .janno (and arbitrary .csv and .tsv) files. This is an adjusted version and hard fork of the qsh package (https://github.com/itchyny/qhs). It is written in Haskell and openly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/poseidon-framework/qjanno/).

## Guide for qjanno

qjanno is a fork of the [qhs](https://github.com/itchyny/qhs) software tool, which is, in turn, inspired by the CLI tool [q](https://github.com/harelba/q). All of them enable SQL queries on delimiter-separated text files (e.g. .csv or .tsv). For qjanno we copied the source code of qhs v0.3.3 (MIT-License) and adjusted it to provide a smooth experience with a special kind of .tsv file: The Poseidon [.janno](janno_details.md) file.

Unlike `trident` or `xerxes` it does not have a complete understaning of the .janno-file structure, though, and (mostly) treats it like a normal .tsv file. It does not validate the files upon reading and takes them at face value. Still .janno files are given special consideration: With the `d(...)` pseudo-function they can be searched recursively and loaded together into one table.

qjanno still supports most features of qhs, so it can still read .csv and .tsv files independently or in conjunction with .janno files.

### How does this work?

On startup, qjanno creates an [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) database [in memory](https://www.sqlite.org/inmemorydb.html). It then reads the requested, structured text files, attributes each column a type (either character or numeric) and writes the contents of the files to tables in the in-memory database. It finally sends the user-provided SQL query to the database, waits for the result, parses it and returns it on the command line.

The query is pre-parsed to extract file names and then forwarded to an SQLite database server via the Haskell library [sqlite-simple](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sqlite-simple). That means qjanno can parse and understand basic SQLite3 syntax, though not everything. [`PRAGMA` functions](https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#syntax), for example, are not available. The examples below show some of the available syntax, but they are not exhaustive. Trial and error is recommended to see what does and what does not work. Please report missing functionality in our [issue board on GitHub](https://github.com/poseidon-framework/qjanno/issues).

### The general interface

This is the CLI interface of qjanno:

```
Usage: qjanno [--version] [QUERY] [-q|--queryFile FILE] [-c|--showColumns]
              [-t|--tabSep] [--sep DELIM] [--noHeader] [--raw] [--noOutHeader]
  Command line tool to allow SQL queries on .janno (and arbitrary .csv and .tsv)
  files.

Available options:
  -h,--help                Show this help text
  --version                Show qjanno version
  QUERY                    MYSQL syntax query with paths to files for table
                           names. See the online documentation for examples. The
                           special table name syntax 'd(path1,path2,...)''
                           treats the paths (path1, path2, ...) as base
                           directories where .janno files are searched
                           recursively. All detected .janno files are merged
                           into one table and can thus be subjected to arbitrary
                           queries.
  -q,--queryFile FILE      Read query from the provided file.
  -c,--showColumns         Don't run the query, but show all available columns
                           in the input files.
  -t,--tabSep              Short for --sep $'\t'.
  --sep DELIM              Input file field delimiter. Will be automatically
                           detected if it's not specified.
  --noHeader               Does the input file have no column names? They will
                           be filled automatically with placeholders of the form
                           c1,c2,c3,...
  --raw                    Return the output table as tsv.
  --noOutHeader            Remove the header line from the output.
```

This help can be accessed with `qjanno -h`. Running `qjanno` without any parameters does not work: The `QUERY` parameter is mandatory and the tool will fail with `Query cannot be empty.`

A basic, working query could look like this:

```
$ qjanno "SELECT Poseidon_ID,Country FROM d(2010_RasmussenNature,2012_MeyerScience)"
.----------------------.-----------.
|     Poseidon_ID      |  Country  |
:======================:===========:
| Inuk.SG              | Greenland |
| A_Mbuti-5.DG         | Congo     |
| A_Yoruba-4.DG        | Nigeria   |
| A_Sardinian-4.DG     | Italy     |
| A_French-4.DG        | France    |
| A_Dinka-4.DG         | Sudan     |
| A_Ju_hoan_North-5.DG | Namibia   |
'----------------------'-----------'
```

qjanno is asked to run the query `SELECT Poseidon_ID,Country FROM d(2010_RasmussenNature,2012_MeyerScience)`, which triggers the following process:

1. As `d(...)` is provided in the table name field (`FROM`), qjanno searches recursively for .janno files in the provided base directories `2010_RasmussenNature` and `2012_MeyerScience`.
2. It finds the .janno files, reads them and merges them (simple row-bind).
3. It writes the resulting table to the SQLite database in memory.
4. Now the actual query gets executed. In this case the `SELECT` statement includes two variables (column names): `Poseidon_ID` and `Country`. The database server returns these two columns for the merged .janno table.
5. qjanno returns the resulting table in a neat, human readable format.
