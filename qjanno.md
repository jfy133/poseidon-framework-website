# qjanno CLI software

`qjanno` is a command line tool to run SQL queries on .janno (and arbitrary .csv and .tsv) files. This is an adjusted version and hard fork of the qsh package (https://github.com/itchyny/qhs). It is written in Haskell and openly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/poseidon-framework/qjanno/).
