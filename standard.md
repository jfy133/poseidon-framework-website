# Standard Definition

Poseidon is a solution for genotype data organisation established within the Department of Archaeogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History (MPI-SHH) in Jena. Here we describe the standard that defines what a valid Poseidon package is.

The Poseidon standard is defined as a directory with specific files:

* a `POSEIDON.yml` file, which gives important meta-information for the package, like author, version and file paths.
* Genotype data in PLINK or EIGENSTRAT format
* An optional (but recommended) so-called "Janno" file, which lists meta-data for each individual in the package
* an optional bibliography file formatted as [BibTeX](http://www.bibtex.org/)
* an optional README file
* an optional CHANGELOG file

Details of this standard are listed in the README of our [github-repo](https://github.com/poseidon-framework/poseidon-framework.github.io)
