# Poseidon Repositories

To be completed...

## Contributing 

The Poseidon framework has a strongly decentralized philosophy and relies very much on a community of users willing to prepare and improve the data in the repositories. We are glad that you are considering this step and we will try to make this as smooth and convenient as possible. To ensure a professional and welcoming atmosphere we would first of all like to ask you to respect our [Contributor Code of Conduct](conduct.md) in all interactions with the Poseidon team and other users on Github and beyond.
